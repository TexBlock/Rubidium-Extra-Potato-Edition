# Rubidium Extra: Potato Edition

**Rubidium Extra: Potato Edition** is a fork of MgRbExtras-i18n by TexTrue, which is a fork of Magnesium/Rubidium Extra by TeamDeusVult.

# Why?

I want to use Rubidium's **"Use Chunk Multi-draw"** function to increase fps but Magnesium/Rubidium Extra breaks it.

MgRbExtras-i18n didn't fix it, as TexTrue just focus on Localization and [Rubidium Toolkit](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium-toolkit).

But Rubidium Toolkit does have performance issue with [DynamicLightsReforged](https://github.com/TeamDeusVult/DynamicLightsReforged), see [#3](https://github.com/TexTrueStudio/RubidiumToolkit/issues/3).

So, I just delete some features of Magnesium/Rubidium Extra and now you can use it with Rubidium!

# Extra Info

Does this version work with [Magnesium](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium-reforged)?

Yes, but I recommend you to use Rubidium instead of Magnesium, cuz Magnesium is abandoned and out-dated.

Why **"Potato Edition"**?

Cuz my team name: MCTeamPotato.

Why don't you delete "FPS Counter" feature? 

[Rubidium Extra](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium-extra) does have this feature, but it looks ugly and Magnesium/Rubidium Extra's FPS Viewer is more beautiful.

I made this version for my modpack, [Tankoptimization](https://github.com/MCTeamPotato/Tankoptimization), best 1.16.5 Forge performance pack.
